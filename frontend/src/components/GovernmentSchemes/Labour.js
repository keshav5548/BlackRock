                  The Self Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual
                  Scavengers (SRMS) was introduced in January 2017 by the

                  identified manual scavengers and their dependants in
                  rehabilitation in alternative occupations. SRMS was revised in
                  November 2013 in consonance with the provision of the
                  “Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their
